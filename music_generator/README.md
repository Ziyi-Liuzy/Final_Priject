# music-generator
Upload a text file into this music generator and python will generate midi data based on it!

Running the generator is simple; go into the command line and run python midifile.py. An file open dialog will appear to allow you to select the text file from which you want to generate music. You will need a good midi soundfont or synthesizer, such as Tambres of heaven (https://midkar.com/soundfonts/), in order for the music to sound its best.

Some examples of the generated music, using the Tambres of Heaven soundfont:
